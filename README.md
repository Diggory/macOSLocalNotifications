# macOSLocalNotifications
## Sample macOS app to send User Notifications with a custom sound.

This application is a minimal viable app to demonstrate sending local notifications [UNUserNotifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) on macOS.

It also uses a custom notification sound.  However, macOS doesn't appear to honour that and the default tone is always used.
